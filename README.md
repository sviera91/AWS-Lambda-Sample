# AWS-Lambda-Sample

This repo has files for creating a sample lambda that retrieves the information of the first 10 objects in a bucket.

To run this template, you must provide the name of the bucket the lambda will get the objects from by passing that value in the template.yaml file. You als need to provide the name of the bucket where the code package will be uploaded to in the deploy.sh file.
